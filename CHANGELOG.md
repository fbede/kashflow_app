# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on a modified version of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). The major difference is that links would only be provided for publicly available builds.

This project also adheres to a modified version of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). In this version, major ui/ux changes and installation requirements mean a bump in the major version number. Any backward compatible feature change is indicated by a bump minor version number. Bug fixes and chores are indicated by bumps in patch version number.

Todo: Make this a private changelog
